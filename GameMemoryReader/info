This program is used to read from the game's memory at runtime in order to gather input variables such as:
  ..* the player's location
  ..* lives remaining
  ..* enemy locations
  
The program is written in C++ and uses the Boost Python library to build a dll that can be converted into a Python module (pyd).
This allows us to call some low level functions from our Python script.

The program also contains code for starting the game when we want to run our script.
  
GMR.cfg should contain the path to the game's executable on your system.
For our purposes, the executable we are using is testapp.exe, rather than GeometryWars.exe, as the former does not need Steam to launch it.
